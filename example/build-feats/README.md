Build FEATS
===========

The `compile_or_link_{m,s}.f90` source files inside
this subdirectory are intended to represent user
code and therefore would preferably be inside the
[../../example/build-feats] subdirectory, but
placing them here causes a linking error with the
Fortran Package Manager (fpm).
